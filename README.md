# WP e-Commerce Theme Engine v2

## About this plugin
The wpec-theme-engine-v2 is a plugin designed to demonstrate our upcoming template / theming engine. This work has been inspired by JJJ and Automattic's efforts on how both bbPress and BuddyPress handle themes. Our goal is to ensure that WP e-Commerce, much like bbPress and BuddyPress, simply works with any WordPress theme.

This plugin is designed for core contributors to test and provide feedback and it is for community theme creators to use to ensure that both existing and new themes are compatible with WP e-Commerce Plugin.

 __This is a development plugin and should not be used on production sites__
